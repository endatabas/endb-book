# endb-book

The Endatabas Book

## Setup

```
cargo install mdbook
cargo install mdbook-linkcheck
```

## Limitations

The `mdbook-pdf` build has been removed for now, as the TOC is too buggy.
The HTML print feature works reasonably well.

## Open Questions

* where does the `Data Types` section go? this is key.
* the tutorial will flow more easily; how do we make the `SQL` section approachable?

## TODO

## TODO: Feedback Required / Later

* whitespace between examples in one box
* Functions - more natural order/grouping of the page?
* ops: env vars, cmd line params, logging, data_dir

* Architecture page could need a refresher (SQLite focus etc).
* NorthWind equivalent?

* In general it would be nice to avoid overflowing the examples so much?
* remove code example overflows
* beef up tutorial
