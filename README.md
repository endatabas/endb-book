# endb-book

The Endatabas Book

## Setup

```
cargo install mdbook
cargo install mdbook-linkcheck
```

## Limitations

The `mdbook-pdf` build has been removed for now, as the TOC is too buggy.
The HTML print feature works reasonably well.

## Open Questions

* where does the `Data Types` section go? this is key.
* the tutorial will flow more easily; how do we make the `SQL` section approachable?

## Inspiration

## TODO

## TODO: Feedback Required / Later

* docker/podman --pull=always
* sub-TOC align with SUMMARY
* blob + hex/unhex => blob section
* coalesce => conditionals

* beef up tutorial

* NorthWind equivalent?
* remove code example overflows
