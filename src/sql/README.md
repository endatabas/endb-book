The SQL Reference contains details and edge cases about Endb SQL.

NOTE: The Endb SQL dialect is under active development.
While most major features of Endb SQL are stable, some more esoteric
features (`MATCH`, path navigation, etc.) may experience naming and
semantics changes before Endb 1.0 is released.
